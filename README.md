# shopkeeper-game

A rebellion has begun to overthrow the corrupt monarchy. You are a shopkeeper sympathetic to the rebel cause; you must identify and server fellow rebel adventurers, while refusing to serve the nasty loyalists.

The rebels have a CODE WORD they use to identify each other that changes from day to day. Try to figure it out and give them the best equipment in your shop. But be advised that the Loyalists are trying to crack the code word, as well...
