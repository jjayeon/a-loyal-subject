# A Loyal Subject

 A Rebellion is underway to overthrow the corrupt monarchy. You are a shopkeeper sympathetic to the Rebel cause, and have been tasked with supplying Rebel adventurers for their missions.

Every day, a handful of adventurers will pass through your shop and attempt to communicate you via a code word. A true Rebel will always know the code word; pay attention to words that come up frequently, and who speaks with confidence versus who's just guessing.

The Loyalists are always working to crack the code, and some days the code word will be compromised. Your fellow Rebels will try to communicate this to you discreetly; pay attention to what they have to say.

Give your best equipment to your Rebel allies and your worst to the Loyalist scum, and hope that the Rebels succeed in their missions and overthrow the monarchy.
